# Tau-CMSDAS

Step1)   Measure jet to tau fake rate from MC. See JetToTauFakeRate.md for instruction

Step2)   Measure tau Id efficiency from MC. See IdEfficiency.md for instruction

Step3)   Make the Roc curve. Use plotRocCurve.py macro

In case you have time you can compare the Jet to tau fake rate between data and MC. All you need is to repeat Step 1 this time on Single Muon dataset and compare it with fake rate from W+Jet MC Simulation samples
